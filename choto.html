            <p><strong>By: The Protagonist, A Science Student</strong></p>

            <p>Dola, Jani naa Tui text a emotions ta bujhte parbi kina but if possible then listen to me please "shore" the name that come from my imagination, cause every wave of sea will come to the shore it's physics, law of nature.</p>
            <p>I love you with mah heart which can turn into red if you hold my hand. Without your touch, I am and will stay indeed an orphaned child who is crying for his love that is out of his reach, but the right side of his brain keeps imagining that the story will come to an start and you will come and hold his hand.</p>
            <p>The child was full of ego because he got criticized by those he thought they loved. He was always judged by the nature of his questions, which have been shut down and put him in the dark, but he can't have that ability to understand without dark background and no colour will be visible with its deepest form.</p>
            <p>You are that light colour for me which can dilute the black colour and make it fade until it becomes white.</p>

            <h2>The Science of the Heart</h2>

            <p>My only lust and love for you is indeed a black hole; no one knows why it exists but everyone, even scientists, have evidence about its presence.</p>
            <p>I want to be in your life like waves come on the shore, in the form of waves, in the influence of "Tu B'Av" and took all her "ke'ev" and threw it to somewhere else where gravity is so high that light and time can't even escape. You are, for me in imagination, like a wave that tore my space fabric and made me the person I always wanted to be.</p>
            <p>I want to be your double slit experiment. When you saw me, I will change my nature and act like what you want to see your lover in your imagination.</p>
            <p>I am attracted to your eyes, but your body is a "killer" which holds me to spin around you like planets spinning around the sun.</p>

            <h2>Waves and Gravity</h2>

            <p>So tell me how should I act right now? Should I regret every moment where my ego acts or cherish every moment that I got the love which will never fade? The sword is in your hand, what you will act will never decrease the love I have for you. I don't know why I am acting like this, but it has never happened before.</p>
            <p>I never thought of myself as being in a lower position. I see myself as a rockstar. Always I loved myself less than the love I have for you, and you are the external force that gave me enough energy to reach a higher state, just like an external force helped an electron to reach its higher state. This is the law of physics, the law of nature, the law of love in the sense of giving deep empathy to someone when they are in a low position and helping them cope with daily life and pushing them to recognize their goals.</p>
            <p>You did that for me, and I got my kickstart to follow my dream. You are that light, mysterious yet visible, and gave warmth to me when I felt cold.</p>

            <h2>A Heartfelt Confession</h2>

            <p>I don't know about your current situation—whether you're eating well, or doing your best in life—but I am still at room number 185, Mohali. But if you have anyone in your life, and if he is the love of your life, then deepest congratulations with no jealousy. But deep down, I have it to some extent, which will stay. But I will wait, hopeful to Almighty that you will come.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "If my love has its highest form, you will come. If not, my love for you will never decrease. You can call at any point of your life, and I will definitely come."
            </blockquote>

            <p>You are a willer and a very brave soul. I admire you.</p>

            <h2>Science and Emotion: A Cosmic Union</h2>

            <p>The protagonist, as a science student with 68% marks, tries to express his feelings through his little understanding of science. Through the language of physics and the universe, he captures a love that feels as vast and mysterious as space itself, filled with beauty, longing, and deep admiration.</p>

            <h2>A Love Rooted in Physics and Nature</h2>
            <p>The protagonist likens his love to a force of nature. The pull towards his love is inevitable, like the waves of the sea being drawn to the shore, governed by the law of physics. His love becomes a metaphor for the powerful forces that shape the universe, a love that is both vast and intimate.</p>

            <h2>Admiration and Transformation</h2>
            <p>He admires the person he loves deeply, not just for their physical beauty but for their strength, their essence, their soul. His love has transformed him, pushing him to strive for something greater, just as an external force pushes an electron to a higher energy state. She is his inspiration, his source of light in the darkness.</p>

            <p>In the end, the protagonist reflects on the nature of love itself—how it’s rooted in nature, in the laws of the universe. His love for this person is as mysterious and real as the forces of gravity, light, and time. And no matter where life takes them, this love will never fade.</p>
